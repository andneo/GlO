# GlO
This is a small side project that I have been working on to bring together various topics that I have been studying during my Undergraduate degree.  
GlO is a Java applet that performs global optimisation of molecular systems (currently I have implemented Lennard-Jones clusters, TIP4P water clusters and benzene clusters).  
Currently only the Basin-Hopping global optimisation metaheuristic is implemented, however I hope to add an evolutionary and swarm algorithm at some point.  
There are three local minimisation algorithms currently implemented (Steepest Descent, Conjugate Gradient and L-BFGS). There are also three line search methods implemented.
